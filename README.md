<h2>Motivation for the Project</h2>

I created an ohmmeter that measures the resistance of a resistor by pressing a button since the button initiates the program to start reading the resistor by supplying current to flow through the resistor I will measure. Using a voltage divider equation I can just attain the voltage of resistor, that is then used to calculate the resistance by using Ohmâ€™s law R = V/I, in which R is the resistance, V is the voltage of the resistor, and I is the current flowing through the resistor. I wrote the code for this program completely in Arduino and utilized only the analog pins to then convert them to digital values as part of the solution for the resistance.
